                The company manages a large network of gas stations across the main land
                United States including both fuel pumps and the surrounding convenience stores.
                They have a system in place to record the customer transactions at each point
                of sale.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                They have been using a loyalty program to identify their customers who use their
                loyalty card alongside their purchases.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                This project looked to expand their existing simplistic approach to be able to
                track the behaviour of customers who are not affiliated with the loyalty program.
                By associating purchases from the same bank card and also bank cards that have
                historically been associated with a loyalty card.
            </p>
            <div class="flow-chart-container"><img class="flow-chart" alt="Flow chart for wallet business logic"/></div>
            <p class='context-text'>
                To do this we created a set of business rules that would switch which payment
                methods were associated with a hypothetical customer's wallet.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                This allowed us to observe customer behaviours in loyalty card customers and apply
                that insight to estimate attributes of anonymous bank card users.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                i.e. We don't have any provided information for this bank card but we can observe
                that its owner is behaving similar to our loyalty card users in the 18-24 age range.

                Unlike many of the other projects, the toughest part of this project was scoping
                out the expectations and getting a clear picture of the acceptance criteria.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                The next layer of challenge that this project posed is the sheer complexity of the
                business logic at hand, it was a gargantuan task to implement this in a way that
                has the ability to scale with the quantity of transactions being sourced.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                There were a significant number of quirks and edge cases that came with the
                requirements that were baked into the design. One of these for example is that
                all cash transactions need to belong to a wallet, however since there is no way to
                tie any cash transactions together they all belong to the same wallet, implying
                to the analysts that there's one trucker with millions of dollar zipping around the
                continent.

                    We successfully created a "wallet" entity that made it easier and more accurate
                    for analysts to monitor customer behaviour.

                    Analysts then produced new insights that were previously unattainable. Fuelling
                    better business decisions driven by data.

                    The approach was built to be maintainable and flexible to any changes in how
                    the business decides how wallets are handled.

                This project was the teetering on the precipice of failure throughout. To achieve a
                project of this scale was not simple to estimate in advance, as a result I grew a
                lot in my ability to work under time constraints and to communicate when
                expectations need to change.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                The complexity of the design is likely the most intricate and nuanced set of
                requirements that I have implemented into an existing warehouse. My ability to
                create complex logic in a way that is not too rigid or inflexible to maintain.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                Documenting and demonstrating the efficacy of this approach helped me improve my
                ability to explain technically complicated work to business stakeholders and
                distill the useful information to the right people.
