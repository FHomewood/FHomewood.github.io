            <p class='context-text'>
                Working in a large insurance company with a large data warehouse, we had a number
                of business-critical calculations that were applied to large scale data.
                These calculations were often complex and required a high level of confidence in
                their accuracy.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                To maintain this confidence, we needed a way to ensure that the calculations were
                correct and that any changes made to the code did not introduce any regressions.
                This is where Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) testing came in.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                BDD testing is a software development approach that focuses on the behaviour of the
                system rather than the implementation details.
                It allows us to define the expected behaviour of the system in a way that is easy
                to understand and maintain.
            </p>

                Here is a sample of the sort of acceptance criteria that the business helped
                define:

                One of the largest hurdles to creating a common business focused language is
                getting the ground work right. This involved extensive collaboration with business
                stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into technical
                requirements.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                Once the base understanding is made the technical team can often derive more
                nuanced requirements by modifying the existing established language.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                If the technical implementation of the plain english is not flexible enough to
                apply to the different contexts the business may apply it to. Then it can cause
                performance slow downs while also causing losing the hard earned trust of the
                business in the flexibility of the codebase entirely.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                As all tests are defined in plain English, it is clear and simple to communicate
                what aspect of the code isn't working when a failure occurs. However, when
                everything is running smoothly it is hard to configure the test reporting to
                properly communicate every area of the business and the significance of each test.

                    We successfully implemented a robust test suite in the existing

                    The new approach built trust with the business to have confidence
                    that the code was robust and aligned with business goals.

                    The common language used to define acceptance criteria improved communication

                This project taught me the highlighted how important the quality of communication
                between teams is. Not just the quantity of communication but the effort to
                understand the world from their perspective and to speak in their terms.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                I have learned that the trust built with the business is always in flux and that it
                is important to spend energy maintaining that confidence through a high level of
                quality in the codebase.
            </p>
            <p class='context-text'>
                I have learned that simply testing brings business value in code stability.
                However, to reach a new summit, having the business review and derive meaning from
                the tests provides further value still by having a shared <i>living specification</i>
                that can change with the business requirements.
